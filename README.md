# Shaastra Techathon 2024: AI/ML Challenge - COVID-19 Death Prediction

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for our project submission in the Shaastra Techathon 2024: AI/ML Challenge! Our team, named **Pioneers**, consisting of Maria Liz Mathew, Sasirekha M, Nidhisha B, and Maneesh V, participated in this challenge with the aim of developing a machine learning model to predict the number of COVID-19 deaths based on available data.

### Objective
The primary objective of our project was to create a robust machine learning model that accurately predicts the number of COVID-19 deaths, leveraging various data points including confirmed cases, recoveries, and state-wise data.

## Report Overview

Our report provides a comprehensive overview of our approach, methodologies, and findings. Here's a brief summary:

1. **Introduction**: We set the context by highlighting the importance of predicting pandemic trajectories for proactive planning and resource allocation.

2. **Temporal Analysis**: We analyzed temporal trends of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries to identify patterns over time.

3. **Geospatial Analysis**: Utilizing geographical plots, we mapped the distribution of COVID-19 cases and deaths across different states in India, aiding in targeted interventions.

4. **Correlation Analysis**: We explored correlations between various variables such as cases, deaths, and recoveries to understand their relationships.

5. **Visualization**: Our data analysis was supplemented by a diverse range of visualization techniques to unravel trends and insights within the dataset.

6. **Approaches/Strategies**: We discussed our rigorous data processing and analysis strategies, including the use of regression models, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks.

7. **Final Model**: Our final model architecture utilized ensemble methods and preprocessing techniques to achieve high predictive accuracy in forecasting pandemic-related deaths.
